## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

A nested route allows you to nest children routes to different pages inside of a parent route. You can nest children routes indefinitely inside a parent route. It also allows you to have your parent component control the rendering of the child component.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

I think that you might want to use a nested route in the case of drop down menus or something that you clicked on that would bring you in deeper into the website depending on what you clicked for example maybe you had a site about movies you had a couple choices and you choice the action category which would give you a list of movies and then another button to sort by a certain decade or a sub category of action movies but basically what you clicked on would drop in a different page based on what you chose.


3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Yes you can pass parameters through a nested route. I think a situation when you might want to pass parameters through to a nested route is when you want to pull up information on a profile you might have clicked on to display user information or by selecting on a user profile and being directed to their profile screen because you passed in the id for that user information and the vue profile page with prama.id

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway that I got from yesterday is watching a different way of setting up a project in vue. I was partnered with Dom and he immediately put a component inside the homepage and then started all the styling right on the component with the same results of the way I usually do it where I style on the homepage and then cut it out and paste into the component. It achieves the same results but it was a cool way of watching somebody else code and be able to get their project up and running much faster than I usually do by just doing the steps in a different manner.

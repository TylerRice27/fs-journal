## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

lifecycle hooks give you a window in your project and at certain points in your project lifecycle hooks are called to do a specific function. Lifecycle hooks also allow users to use their own code at certain stages of lifecycle process. Lifecycle hooks are used for initialization, Dom insertion, Updating and Destroy your component.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

I believe I have implemented a lifecycle hook inside my afternoon project specifically the mounted lifecycle hook. In our project today with greglist I built out my house page how I wanted it to look and then I created a component and moved what I wanted it to look like into a component then from there I injected that component into template which is mounting what a component is directly to my DOM.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks are used if you need to access or modify the Dom. The mounting hook works similar to how are draw function that we were using in earlier weeks of the program but instead of having write a function to draw it to the screen it will automatically inject it into the dom for you. I think there could be many different cases on when you would want to use a mounting hook because you want your user to be able to see the information without having to open the inspect tools. I believe you would use a mount hook when you are trying to render a single item to the page like we did with the Api images in checkpoint 4 and the Nasa assignment and finally when we are doing a v-for over a component and putting that item right into our template to be displayed for our user.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One takeaway that I got from today's assignment is a better understanding of how a v-for works as well as the objects in my AppState that I am pulling from my api. While working on todays assignment I was struggling to figure out why my information was no displaying on my page even though it was showing up correctly on my vue page on my house page but what Harrsion explained to me is that even though everything was named correctly within my house page because I was dealing with an array of objects I had to a v-for before I could get it to display on my page because since it was a collection it didn't know which one to display on the screen. When I wrote the v-for on my component it was able to iterate over that array and populate the houses to my screen because it could see what each one belonged to which was different than the pervious assignment where I was able to inject the picture straight away once I got the information because it was set to null and I did not need to v-for over it to get that information from my AppState to display.

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing allows you to get a basic layout and design idea of your website without having to spend a lot of time, money and resources on building out a whole website to find out that it might not work. It will also give you a direction to head towards when building out your website.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There is low-fidelity, mid-fidelity and high-fidelity. Low fidelity is useful to get a basic understanding of how your website will look and maybe how your website flows throughout each page and it is practically free. Mid-fidelity shows a more accurate representation of what you want your page to look like and helps you define specific elements of the page without adding images to the page. Finally, high-fidelity will allow you to build a wire-frame that closely matches what your website may look like, allowing you to define pixel-specific-layout, images and navigation design that users will experience when using your website.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes I do believe wire-frames are worth the time, energy and effort because it allows you to create a basic design and inspiration for your website before you build a complicated website and it doesn't work properly or it has too much content and it is not easy for the user to use. In short, by putting some time, energy and effort into wire-framing it may save more time, energy, effort and possibly money in the long run.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

That wire-frames are definitely worth the time to visualize a concept for your website and that there are a lot of free tools and websites to be able to do it. The tool we used figma was easy and fun to use to quickly build out some basic design for our website. Also today's assignment helped me understand that if you build containers,rows and columns you properly sometimes you can copy groups of code and quickly use it as a template for the rest of your website.

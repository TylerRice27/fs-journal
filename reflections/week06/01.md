## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?

Component base architecture you are building out individual items that you can use for your whole application but work independently from each other. You are also building out things vertically rather than horizontally meaning you are building out items using classes where all of the the functionality for that component is put within its class in the same file.

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

A benefit to component based architecture is the speed at which you can build your website using components. You can inject components into your website without having to redesign the whole structure of your website. It can also make debugging potentially easier because all of your code for the specific component you are working on is in the same place. Finally it may make sharing other developers code easier because if you were working on a project you may be able to take something that someone has already built and inject it right into your project similarly how we do with bootstrap.

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

A potential drawback with using the component based architecture is the readability because everything for one single component is in one file using a class the more you add to that component the harder it may get to read and manage down the road. Finally another drawback with component based architecture is people overusing components because of how easy to use they are. Instead of using components for specific situations or when it is the right tool for the job people might use them for every aspect of their project when it might hurt the overall structure of their project.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway from this assignment I got was the difference between one way data binding and two way data binding. Basically the way that I understood it is that by one way binding you can easily change different items in your code and can draw them to your page which is really good for components that you don't want to change or you has a developer will be the only one to change them but two way binding by adding V-model you are able to changes things on your page but also create elements in your page that your user can change. In the example in the playground it allowed me to change the name directly on the website and it just changed on my code until I refreshed my page which seems like it could have a lot of really useful situations once we are able to keep the items stay on reload.

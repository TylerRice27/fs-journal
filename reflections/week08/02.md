## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication on a small team because it allows everyone to stay informed on what every team member is working on while at the same time communicating about the overall project and it status as it relates to our overall deadline with that project. It is also important on how you communicate in the reading they started using other means of communications besides team meeting allowing them to do fewer meetings throughout the week allowing the dev team to work on their project and not disrupt their work flow.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Some adjustments that may need to be made with small team scrums is communication and stepping up to deliver the best project you can to your client. So first off because you don't have a lot of people working on the project you really need to get hour you can out of coding so inside of doing multiple meetings or one big meeting it maybe more beneficial to do one small meeting in the morning and then the rest of the day communicate through slack or some other communication app to communicate small matters and then regroup the next day for your morning meeting. The second adjustment you may need to make is more of a personal adjustment like taking on front end work even though you are a back end developer or prefer backend work. If you don't have anybody to take on certain tasks someone will probably have to go outside their comfort zone a little bit to be able to finish the project on time.


3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle is the paradox that is the set of tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of the software delivered. The tradeoff to each side of this triangle are if you want a good product and you want it at a low cost it will not be fast. The other tradeoff is if you want a final product that is really good and done really quickly it will not be cheap and will require a lot of developers to get it done. Finally probably the worst tradeoff is if you want something cheap and fast then the final product will not be a high quality.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

A takeaway from today's work is that after kind of planning the whole project on a really broad level we were able to narrow down our scope and be like what do we have to get done today for our pitch and I think this lesson is going to be really helpful for our whole capstone. Instead of always thinking about everything all time instead save that for team meetings but for our day to day to get things down ask ourselves what we want to get done today that way we can divide the problems and tackle them better as a group and also still achieve our daily goal.

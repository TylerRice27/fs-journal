## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Planning before writing code allows you to think about what your application is trying to achieve before just jumping in and writing code with out thinking or having a rough outline of your project. Also on a micro level it might help you write better functions by planning out what the function is trying to achieve and how you could write that function in a proper way to hopefully cut down on the amount of bugs. Also I believe planning before writing code might also help with debugging the code that you have on the page already by taking some time to read your code out loud and think about the functionally of the code you written and modifying it accordingly.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

One thing you can do is look at your code and think about what you are trying achieve in your functionality of the code and see if your code can be rewritten in a way to make more clear and readable to hopefully solve your problem when you are stuck. Another option that the author mentions is to google your problem, most likely you are not the first person to run into a problem and someone else could have ran into a similar problem and figured a solution so that could be a helpful resource to use. However it is important not to copy and paste other people's code that fixed the problem without understanding it. It is probably a good idea to use their code as a reference and go through it but you want to understand it so you can avoid similar problems in the future. Finally the author mentions building test checks which I assume is a similar mentality to code small, miss small which by console logging and writing test into your code it may help you down the line when you do get stuck to hopefully not be stuck as long.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Some of the key takeaways that I got from this article is think and plan more about what I am trying to achieve before I start coding in regards to my whole project but at the same in regards to my individual functions before I just start typing. Making sure my code is readable to the person reviewing my code and also readable for me to read so I understand what I am doing. Another takeaway is leaving comments all over your code I am totally guilty of this when the author was mention this I will usually write what a specific code is doing above it that way I understand it and can refer back to it if I run into a similar problem but I would like to get to the point that he mentions about maybe just rewriting your code in a way that it already explains what it does in the code without needing the extra comments. Always write test checks into your code to make sure code is working properly never assume everything is working perfectly. Finally using code reviews and errors that I get as learning opportunities the author mentions that newbies hate errors and code reviews. As a newbie I wouldn't say I hate errors they just frustrate me because I sometimes my get stuck on them for hours however I think I should view them as learning opportunities of learning how to solve problems so that way I don't get those same errors in similar projects. In regards to code reviews I definitely don't hate them but I would say that sometimes I do fear them because like most people I don't like to fail or mess up or look dumb but I think that is all part of the learning process and I need to fail and go over code to be able to learn how to get better at writing code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway that I had for this project is that me and my partner ran into a problem where we set an interval for the boss attacks but later on as we started to build out our project we also needed to clear that interval because after our boss leveled up because the player beat him or the player reset the game it would reset the health bar but would not reset the interval so eventually if you clicked the reset game button ten times it would stack on top of each other and we would be playing an impossible game at that point. So we had to clear the interval so after a lot of struggling and problem solving we ended up with a solution of having to write a new function for the attack interval and calling a variable of interval and then later creating a function where we cleared that interval by clearing(interval) which basically cleared our interval before allowing the boss attack interval to start again after the player reset the game. This solved our problem of stacking attack interval doing more and more damage to the player.

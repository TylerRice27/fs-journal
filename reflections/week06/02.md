## Questions

1. What are props?

Props are how we pass data from one component to another. Specifically it allows you to pass props from a parent component to a child component but does not allow you to pass it the other way around. Props basically store the component information within them. Another thing to note is that props can not be modified once they are passed down they have to modified inside the file where that component is stored.

2. What are props used for?

Props are used for passing components from one another specifically from parent components into child components where they can be accessed. Once they are passed down they then can be used to be injected straight into our template html.

3. Where can props be used or accessed?

Props once they are passed down to the different pages/views they can be injected into our html template. We can pass props into that template just by using the specific props name you don't have "this.name" or anything like that because will do it for you automatically. We can use props in other parts of our application besides template if we use a computed prop we can use them in other tools like Watchers, Lifecycle hooks and Methods

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway that I got from today's assignment is just getting better at using the vue tool and becoming more familiar with it and how it operates. The first thing was I accessed my data and logged it and it was all showing up on my consoles however in my page section I had not done an onMounted to retrieve the data from my service to be able to see in my vue dev tools which was causing me problems because I wanted to make sure I got my data before I drew anything to the page but even if I onMounted any of my data it wasn't going to draw to my page until I put it into my return section and then called within my template. Another takeaway is setting my item in my appState to null if it is a single item that I am grabbing and if it is a collection of items then I should set it to an empty array because it makes working with my apis and calling that data much easier by setting those properly in the beginning.

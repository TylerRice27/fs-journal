# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


As a group I think we did a great job of communicating and working together on fixing our issues to make a great project. We also shuffled the group in a great way to allow everyone to get experience with front end and back end and also allows everyone to change partners.


I was shocked that we were able to make it to phase two of our project and also that we used three apis in our final project for all of our features.


It was a really fun two weeks working on a project with others and creating a great project to show to future employers.

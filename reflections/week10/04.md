## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is allows you to use unique types while also mapping them to a symbolic name. In other words it allows you to take a word like Rock and connect a data value type like an int and connect the two. Example "Rock = 1"

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify different aspects of an Enum. You can modify the base type of an Enum which is usually set to an int but you can change it to one of the other number types like "short" for example. You change the base type by writing public enum "Volume : short {}".

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

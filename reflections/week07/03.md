## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

User experience is every interaction that the user will have on your website no matter what webpage they are on or if they are on desktop/laptop or mobile version. The goal is to allow the user to do what they want when they are interacting with your website. You should consider how the user interacts with the website and you should try to put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself how would you like your website to function if you were customer on the webpage.


2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

The first benefit to considering user experience is better design and wether your website is inviting or not. The example I can think of is going to a website and immediately getting hit with a ad to subscribe or buy something even before you have looked at the website which seems aggressive but it might be better to setup a timer or trigger event to make pop event come up after your halfway through the website rather than at the beginning. The other thing is it easy to navigate and does it have good accessibility features to make things like feeling out forms easier and making things editable rather than having to retype everything.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

The reason that I believe why you would spend all that prep work laying out your page, making figma frameworks and testing before your launch your website is really for the customer/user experience. A website is kind of like any other business or place you interact with just in a virtual sense. What I mean by that is if you went to a restaurant and it wasn't clean and the people weren't nice you probably wouldn't go back and I think the same thing applies for any website you want the user to have a good time while using your website wether they use your website for 5 mins or come back daily.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The takeaway from todays assignment is mainly working with postman and just getting better at using the software and learning how to write functions and test those functions on the backend. Another takeaway was time management I think I did a good job staying focused and working but I thought that I would have backend done by end of Wednesday with maybe some time to move on to the frontend but that was not the case instead it took me until Thursday morning morning to get the backend done and I think that was my takeaway about just managing expectations of how long everything will take especially with a fullstack app like this.

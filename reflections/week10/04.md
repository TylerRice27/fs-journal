## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

An enum is allows you to use unique types while also mapping them to a symbolic name. In other words it allows you to take a word like Rock and connect a data value type like an int and connect the two. Example "Rock = 1"

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can modify different aspects of an Enum. You can modify the base type of an Enum which is usually set to an int but you can change it to one of the other number types like "short" for example. You change the base type by writing public enum "Volume : short {}".

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

One way I could use Enums is in the current project I started working on AllSpice. In the category section instead of using a type string I could create an Enum with three specific types of categories Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner that way on the frontend I could have gave my user a dropdown menu to select the three options and then those options could have been associated with a number value on my back end. Another project that I could have used an enum on which is really similar to the example given was the Rock, Paper and Scissor project. In my project I ended up doing a switch case for what the player choose and what the computer choose and it was case 1,2 and 3 for the different options that the computer would choose and then the player options inside those 3 choices but instead I could have used an Enum in the same way and said 1 = Rock, 2 = Paper and 3=Scissors that way my switch cases could have been more readable for another developer instead of 1, 2, 3 it would have been Rock, Paper and Scissors which is much cleaner.

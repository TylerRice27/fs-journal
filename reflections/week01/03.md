## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I think my favorite tip for benefiting my design is using less borders. When learning CSS and bootstrap I really wanted to section things in box or grids, which I think is a good way to learn and break things down but after making a basic format for my website it might be a good idea to go back and use more subtle changes such as drop shadows, spacing and background color to get the same desired effect without being so jarring to the user. I could maybe revert to a accent border if I want to highlight a specific part of my website.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

The Dribble website seems like a great way to get a lot of ideas for color and style to use on my website

I found this website which doesn't have templates but I thought it was a really cool design that allows you to scroll your mouse through the web page and transitions from page to page without having to click on a button to get the next page. Maybe something to aspire to has my skills improve.

Here is another website with some great templates you can click on with links to the company/designers website

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Like most things people decide whether they like something based on first impressions and within a couple minutes so I would assume a website is no different. By having good website design the user would like the way the website looks while also being able to understand how to navigate the website easily. Most people now a days will look at website on their phones so if the website has bad design on their phones then they most likely wont spend the time opening up a laptop to look at your website. Some things I think you could convey through design alone is the items your selling through images or maybe an imbedded video on your front page. As well as having a navbar on top of your page with clean dropdowns to be able manuever to other pages of your website while still looking good but being very effective and easy for the user.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

If your trying to build a website or mock a design bootstrap is a great tool to be able to create a basic website with good design that matches a lot of modern design in website without having to build it all out yourself. If you follow the grid system you can use code that has already been designed for you so you focus on other parts of your website or just touch up the small design elements while having the majority of the website already laid out.

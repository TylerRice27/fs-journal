## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

The two common operations are the get and set operator. The get operator gets the value of the item stored in the key. The set operator sets the a new key to the object.


2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

I should make sure that I return my get function after writing that function so I dont fall into a Get trap. In the example the reading game they made a get function and gave it a string to log. Then later down the line they created a new variable but they passed two parameters through it but because they did not return their get function that they created before they based the it through the new proxy object it grabbed the string and overrode the name value of the person. So my understanding is that the name of the person never went through the argument because it though it already had the value stored within the parameter so it logged the first and then undefined the second.


3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

Some of the benefits of using the get function that we are using a lot in our application is that we are able to inject html into our javascript by creating a template and having it stored until the user clicks a button or adds an item through a form. It is very handy for two different reasons one is that for defined amount of items you create a template for one of them and then use that template for all the rest instead of having to do each one individually with saves time and also future proofs your website if you want to add more later. Secondly it is extremely helpful when it comes to forms or user entered information, in this situation you cant decide the exact item the user is going to put in but by making templates they can enter their own items and it will still log the information and draws it to the screen in a clean format. Another example the reading gives that I haven't used much of is the set function but I think this might be handy if you wanted to make it so users can only enter numbers you can set it so if it does not equal a number it will throw. It might also be useful with finding a specific item in a search by and id or possibly deleting an item making it equal to the same id the user clicked on.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment


One of the takeaways that I had with this project was struggling to inject my form into my html and also making sure the house that I created went to the right draw screen. I started with hard coding my items into my screen so I could see what my items would look like on screen and also creating two houses in my AppState just to define what a house is however where I struggled is with the forms and making sure the house form showed up and not the car form showed up and that the house you created went to the right draw screen. So I still need to do more practice on this project and situation in the future but one thing I found help is just organization because multiple catagories made it more difficult but just double checking what my specif functions where doing and that they were all named correctly and being injected into the right id's really helped.

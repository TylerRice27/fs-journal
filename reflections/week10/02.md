## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list in C# is a list of typed objects that can be any generic type that can be represented by T. T can represent strings and int which can be put in a list and accessed by index or you modify the list using different list methods.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

There is a lot of different List methods but some of the methods that I think you would use the most are Add, Clear and Find to just name a few that might be most commonly used. The reason I think that these methods will be the most used is that they seem like the most broad and most common methods to do for example going back to tower if we wanted create an event in a post request it sounds like you could use a Add list method in a similar way and then just keeping adding the newest one to the end of the list. Clear I would have used all the way back when I did moody kittens there was a requirement to delete all cats which clear seems like a perfect method to use to assign a button that runs that clear method. Finally find seems like a great list method for a put request which we use quite often for our projects to allow our users to edit the item.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

You would want to use a method that would pull the item from the array based on the value of that item or possibly on the index position of that item if you know what position it is within the list. The methods that I think would be best to used to retrieve an item from a list is the List.Find and List.FindIndex method.

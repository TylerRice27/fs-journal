## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. In simple terms rest transfers information to the client who is using the API based on the state of information trying to be accessed and then will represent that information the user trying to access that information.


2. What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means that the API does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. Since it doesn't remember any information or pervious request of the user the user has to include all of the information to send to the API every single time you want to perform a crude function.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

The URL pattern that is used when making request to API is all the same even if it coming from different coding languages like Python or Javascript. An example of the URL Pattern is http://example.com/api/items.json

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment


One takeaway that I learned is that there is another way of using string html. When I was working on this group project with my partner we were discussing the best way to get information on the screen and I suggested that we make an get template to put a single line of code on the string and instead suggested a different way by just injecting the string html right into a forEach function rather creating a separate template for it. Which I never would have thought about but it was definitely an interesting idea.

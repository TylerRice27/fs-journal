## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

A github action are text files that you can put into your github repository under your workflow folder that run specific actions. You can make github actions run at a certain time or can create a github action that runs off a specific github action like someone forking your project from github. You can also create up to twenty different files to run different actions that can run many jobs when that action file is triggered.

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

Github actions provide the benefit of automation. Once you write you Github actions to run on a specific event it will do it every time that action is called. For example if you create an action that runs on a pull request it will run that action every time a different user does a pull request which is handy for you has the developer not having to micromanage that action on Github. Another benefit is that there are a lot of free action templates out there so you don't have to reinvent the wheel but instead can instead use somebody elses action or customize it to your needs.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

A workflow can use a scheduled, webhook or and external trigger depending on how you want the event to trigger the action. A scheduled trigger can run an action on a recurring schedule or time. For example if you wanted your action to run every hour or once a day at a certain time it would perform that action. A webhook action is performed when a certain event or situation takes place on your github like a pull or a push request. Finally a external trigger is similar to a webhook but instead it is for when you want to trigger an activity that happens outside of Github.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

A takeaway from today was learning how to deploy a project to heroku application and making sure that you run your npm I build in the right folder so you don't create conflicts or instead make the mistake that I did and push the server side of your project to website which does not look has nice has the client side. This was a great takeaway because we just finished our MVP of our project before we left for the day and we will be deploying our project when we get in first thing in the morning so hopefully this deploying takeaway will benefit us for deploying our MVP and our phase two down the road.

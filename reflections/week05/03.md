## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

In simple terms timeboxing is scheduling a time for each task that you have to complete no matter how small or big that it is. It forces you to allocate time to each given task that you have so you don't put off that task. It also gives people who are perfectionists a time window so that way they can move onto their next task instead of nite picking the fine detail. It also helps the creative people by giving them a sense of urgency with a small deadline so they focus on the task more so they will get it done in a timely manner.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

The first strategy i would like to implement is swallowing the frog or doing the hardest or the thing I most afraid of first. When I come home after class I will usually take 30 min to hour break before I jump back into school/coding and I usually start with journals but I sometimes I miss out on my afternoon projects and working on those a little more because I feel they are harder and also intimidates me a little so it might be more beneficial for me to work on those first and then go to my journals. The next thing I would like to implement is working on my golden hour I am defiantly a night person and I believe that I am most productive from 7pm to about 10pm and I would like to optimize that time more and also just be mindful of myself throughout the day to see when I feel the best to determine the best time for me to work on my school work. The other thing I would like to get better at is strategic quitting, a lot of times especially during the weekend checkpoints I will hit a wall and I will want to keep working to finish the project or the specific challenge that I am having but I am less productive during this time and I am also more emotionally stressed so it might be a good idea to give it a timebox when I run into a problem and then strategically quit and either work on a different section of my project or just take a small break from the whole thing if I am super stressed.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

The example I can give that timeboxing would have helped me is during the weekend 3 and 4. In both situations I ran into a problem with my code and didn't really know where to proceed and fix the problem. Both times I got really mad and it wasn't very productive and I eventually took a break but it would have more beneficial for me to time box and either move on to a different section of my project or take a break entirely and then circle back to the problems that I had and then timebox for fixing the errors that I was running into.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One thing that I got to work on today and get a better understanding of was working on queries as well as linking the parent and child objects. In my specific situation I was trying to link the galaxies to the stars that reside within that galaxy however I was running into a lot of problems with how to give the star the galaxy id as well how to find the specific stars within the galaxy by searching and what I was missing was the req.params.id because the in my mind I thought the GalaxyId: was the id attached to the star but it wasn't that was just identifier and I missing the actual id which was the req.params.id.

# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?




I think that I made really good progress on my backend side of my website. I would have liked to have been done with my backend before the end of wednesday or earlier but I think I did a good job of narrowly missing that goal. I also think I did a little bit better at time boxing this week by trying to take more breaks when I got stuck but also by setting little goals during my project to try and hit those things by a specific time.


What I would have done differently this week is take time before I start coding out every webpage and think a little bit more about how I want to layout the page. How are the buttons going to work for my requirements and how are those buttons going to work for good UI design. I also would have tried to use the reference code a little better and not jump around so much to different things before I moved on because it began to much to juggle and overwhelming.

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

The three states to a promise are pending, resolved and rejected. The pending is when the promise is first made but before the promise is resolved or rejected. The resolved state is when the promise kept and the promise comes back as completed or fulfilled. The opposite is the case for rejected it is when the promise fails or is not kept.


2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

The promise seeks to keep you from getting into callback hell by using promises then and catch. With promises it allows you to chain multiple async operations. Instead of having to multiple callbacks success and failures you can write it in a way were if it succeeds it will go to the next line of code however if it fails at any point it will run bottom line of code the catch portion and run that response/result instead.


3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The difference between the "then()" method and the "catch()" method is that the "then" method is used if the promise was successful and accepted it will run the "then" method you declared. However if the "then" method comes back as failed it will instead jump to the next line of code and run the "catch()" method which will have a different response like throwing the user an error message so they know something went wrong with the request or promise that they made.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One takeaway that I got during today's assignment is practicing good coding habit and always logging the res, or in other words always logging after trying to get res.data so you know exactly the kind of data that you will get from the api you are trying to retrieve from. Another cool takeaway that I learned today that was kind of built into our greglist project is that you can have one modal but multiple different forms attached to it. I ran into an error while I writing my code and a big reason was because I didn't fully understand the fact that instead of writing multiple different modals for each function instead we were using the same modal but injecting different forms into that modal based on wether or not my car existed. I had to write an extra function inside my car form and inject into my html string but I think in the long run it is a much cleaner way to write code and also it may help if we ever wanted to add more catagories to the greglist assignment.

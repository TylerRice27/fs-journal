## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

The three ways to write a function are function declaration, function expressions and arrow function expressions. So a function declaration allows you to define a named function by using the keyword function before you the name of that function. It also hoists the function allowing you to use the function before it is defined in your code. The next function is function expressions which allow you to define an anonymous function however it does not hoist these functions so you can use it before it is defined like you can with function declaration. Finally an arrow function is a short hand for writing less code while still writing a function expression. 


2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Arguments are the value that your parameters receive where as parameters are the names given inside the function definition. The arguments or values that we have are passed into the parameters that we named. For our function to return a value we have to pass our parameters as an argument.
Example:
let arg1 = red;


function Params(param1) {
 // function statements
}
Params(red);

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

High order functions are when a function passes another function as a parameter or it returns a function as it result. In the example I give below I defined the number 1 and number 2 and then I wrote a function to call upon a different a function as well as the two numbers that I defined then later in my code I wrote the function for adding the numbers together that I reference earlier in my call function so that way when I type callOperation it should give me the result of 10 by running the numbers and the function together.

let number1= 8
let number2= 2
function callOperation(addNumbers, number1, number2){

}
function addNumbers{
    return number1 + number2
}

callOperation() == 10

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The big takeaway that I got from today's assignment and lecture is finding different ways to write your code to clean it up. In the lecture when we were using filter and find methods to find and filter out different villains for the game. When we first started we were writing out a specific function for each individual attribute which was a great way to learn how to use those different functions however it only works well if you have a set amount of variables to filter through. Later on we wrote a function that applied to all the different attributes as long as we named them correctly in our html and referred to the right property in our array that we put as our Const in the top section of our code. The great thing I learned today about writing a function that can pass multiple data types rather than just one data type is that it can make your life much easier down the road only having to update a few lines of code rather than having to go into each data's type function that we wrote specifically for that function.

## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code documentation you are writing out what you code function do before you write the actual code. It is kind of like pseudo coding before you actually starting writing the code to figure out what you want the code to do has well has what to name things within you code. You can write a guide on how to use your code. You can also write a Readme file within your code for other people to check on if they have questions and finally most valuable you can write documentation layer called JSDoc right above the actual code you are writing.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

The first benefit is it helps you remember what your code is actually doing if you have been away from the project for a long time and you don't remember what you wrote so it will help you later on by leaving yourself a note. It also helps other developers you are working with know what your code does and what type of parameter you are passing through. Finally it will help you while you are actually writing the code because you intellisense will actually give you hints if you mess up while actually writing the functions because it is using the JSDoc that you wrote before writing your code.

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

Code documentation is very important and seems like a good habit to get into as junior developer because it will save you and possibly you colleagues a lot of time and headaches down the road. It allows you to write better and cleaner code with the assistance of intellisense as well as thinking out your problem before you starting writing your code making the code you actually write cleaner and easier to read. Finally it seems valuable to write some documentation to your code even after you write the function just in case you did not document your code before you started writing so you can summarize what your code does so you can help yourself and other developers down the road.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway from todays assignment was the difficulty of many to many relationships and how we has a group wanted them to interact with each other. When we writing our Album members on the back end we wrote a create and a delete function which worked really well for our album member but once we got to our frontend we weren't able to draw them to the screen because we didn't write a get function in our Album controller so we had to go back and write it. So the takeaway that I got is to just take a little extra time while thinking about each component on the backend and how we want our user to interact with these items. The hard part was instead of writing it through albumMembers service and controller it was actually in the Album controller but then passed to the albumMembers service.

# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?



I think what has went well this week is that I have a good understanding of how to setup my backend files so that each item has a model, controller, service and a repository. I also I feel like  I am getting better at the C# syntax the more I practice writing them out.

One thing that I am struggling on is relationships and how to create different methods for those relationships and how to write them in C# that way I don't get any errors. Another thing that I am struggling with is with SQL a little but more specifically the repository layer and what that is doing with my SQL data. I think the sql database is the data that I am creating and the repository is what grabs that data and then sends what I need to the service so you can do what you need to do with those items.

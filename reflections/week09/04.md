## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

An SSL certificate are small data files that establish a secure link between the server and browser to help protect the users sensitive information.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

There are many different types of certificates the first one is an extended validation certificate which is the most expensive validation certificate but also is the most secure. This certificate usually shows the business name and country in the address bar and shows that you are legally collecting sensitive information like credit card information so it needs to be secure. The next certificate is Organization validation which is the middle tier of security and this is shown by a green padlock and the company name afterwards. The lowest level of security is Domain validation which is shown just by a green padlock. Which shows that you are collecting people data through encryption but you don't know who is receiving that encrypted information. The advantage to the domain validation is the fact that it is the most affordable type of validation certificate. 

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

The first benefit to using SSL certificates is that keeps your user information secure which reduces the amount of security risks that your website may have if you collect any information from your user. The other advantage to using an SSL certificate is that you also may get a bump in "SEO" or search engine optimization allowing your website to appear in top section of the google search results which in return drives more users to your website.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

A takeaway that I got from todays work is making sure when you add a new feature to your website talking about what is it actually going to add to the user and how do we want to tackle the problem. In our application we were going to add a map to our website with pins of the restaurants that you added to your quests and a couple of people in our group worked on this map function and we spent a whole afternoon trying to figure it out with mapbox and trying to use this new api. After all was said and done we had made no project with this map feature and we really should have discussed it a little longer has a group what does this map look like and what does it add to the user experience. We eventually were able to get the map feature working using the google maps api because we only need a few things from the api but it would have saved us a lot of time if we would have researched both apis as a group more before hand and asked ourselves what is the main thing we are trying to achieve with this feature.

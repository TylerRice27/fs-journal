## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming is when two computer programmers share a single workspace to code basically working off of one computer. On programmer is known as the driver and the driver is the one who is at the keyboard and typing in the code on the screen. The other role is the navigator who helps oversee the overall direction of the project and helps the driver accomplish tasks. Ideally the two programmers swap roles every few minutes.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

Some of the benefits of pair programming is it increases the code quality, it helps with debugging and helps junior developers as well people struggling with a specific component learn more by being paired with somebody who has more knowledge. You are able to have better code quality because you can talk through problems and logic of the code you are writing as well as refracture the code together to make it more readable.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Some drawbacks for pair programming would be people being passive and not actively engaging as a programmer especially when it comes to the navigator role because some might treat it as a break rather than a role to help the driver write good code. Another drawback would be relationship issues with pair programming you want want the pair of programmers to work effectively with each other and not worried about other relationship issues that might persists.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One takeaway that I got from this project that I was not expecting was during the setup process of our assignment. When my partner and I were setting up our project we changed all of our env and got them all setup but we were getting a lot of errors in our terminal and it was because we did not know how to setup a fullstack project yet. So we did not know that we had to run npm i in our server folder and then open up the workspace section in our vs code because it was only showing us the top level files and folders.

> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

Javascript had a problem with updating the page in response to certain events. The observer pattern seeks to solve this problem by creating code that is reusable to your specif thing that you are trying to achieve with your website application. The observer pattern is a lot like the applications we have been writing in class by creating templates we can make something that is reusable and only have to update the new item in the AppState to add a new item or a better example of this is when a user enters there information in a form and it generates a template by reusing html code and just interjecting the string data.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanisms of the observer pattern are subscribe, unsubscribe and the last one is broadcast. The first is subscribe which allows you grab the list of items that are in an array and add items to it. On the opposite end of the spectrum there is unsubscribe which allows you to filter out the items that you don't match the one you are looking for and they get to stay instead of being deleted. Instead it filters for the item that you are looking for and deletes that one. Finally you have the observer pattern which iterates through the array and then for every single item in the array it calls it back to you which we have been using to draw items to the screen for every single item.


3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

I believe the observer pattern is using the three different methods to add items, draw items to the screen and then finally deleting the items. When we add items to our project by entering the data in the form I think it is using the subscribe method my grabbing the current array and the pushing() the item into that array. The next method is broadcasting when we add an item to the screen it is iterating through the array and creating a draw function by grabbing the reusable templates we made for each item. Finally the last method is unsubscribing which we are using when we want to delete the items by filtering through and deleting the one we clicked on. The observer pattern allows us to do all of these things while responding to the events on the page that the user is generating in real time.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Some key takeaways for this project where trying where to decided to start with our project. Creating a form and injecting items inside our parent object. The first small takeaway was not really problem but more of a difference of perspective. I usually start my projects by hard coding some html on the page and getting a general layout but while working with my partner they wanted to start in AppState so it was interesting to see both methods work but just approached in a different way which I feel like will come in handy with working in teams at a future employer. Another key takeaway was organization and building the right items first. While doing our project we accidentally created the list items first before we created the list to hold the items which ended up causing us some problems down the road but it was also a big learning moment for me.

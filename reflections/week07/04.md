# Sprint Retrospective

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

For my partner project we definitely we defiantly implement pair programming and allowing one person to be the driver while the other two people were the navigators helping the driver write code and reference what type just in case they got lost at any point. I feel we were able to get farther in a shorter amount of time by implementing this pair programming method. 

2. What went well this week?

I think has a group we did really well on letting everybody having time to code and also time help be a navigator to try and keep the person coding on track and help them with the code. I also think that the group I had was really great at bouncing ideas off of each other and hearing everybody's ideas out to try and make the best website we could.

3. What would you do differently?

I wouldn't have changed a whole lot with the group I had and how we handled the group project. The only thing I think I would have done differently is tried to stay on topic and coding more like in most group settings there should be comradery and some off topic discussion but I am going to try the next time I am in a group to try and keep us focused on coding and working until we take our designated breaks.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One takeaway that I got from this assignment is watching some of my group members debug on the backend. Instead of using debuggers the person I was partnered with instead used breakpoints on the backend and I noticed that I was not doing that has much when I was writing server side code. So I would like to implement more breakpoints with my code when I get stuck and start using that as one of my go to tools when I run into an issue while working on back-end programming.

## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
It allows developers to save a backup version of their code as well as have a website to share their code to other developers who maybe working on the same project. Also allows developers to go back to an old version of their code kind of like a fail safe.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
The benefits of multiple branches allows the developers to work on different code for the same project to be able to test out new ideas without compromising the initial master branch and then later merge them together.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a software that allows you to track changes that you have made with your code by creating branches. Github is a website that allows you to push code from you local repository to a remote repository where other developers can see your code as well pull your code to work on it on their end.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The takeaway that I got is that git allows you to create multiple branches to test things about before you ruin your main branch and that Github is a great resource to use to have a backup save of your code on the website as well as a great way for developers to work together without having to be at the same computer or office.

## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

The three different relationships are one to one relationship, the one to many relationship and the many to many relationship. One to one relationships only interact with one other object where as one to many might have one item that can only be generated once but it's other data that it interacts with can have multiple pieces of data. Finally many to many are two objects that may receive multiple items of data throughout time.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Some of the benefits of linking are seen over embedding when it comes to one to many or many to many applications. In the example the reading gave by linking it would keep the file size of the original blog post under 16mb where as embedding would add those files into that original post and could eventually go past that file size limit. The other advantage is that linking does not have the same problem with correct document padding when it comes embedding as more and more things are added to the file.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

A challenge of a many to many relationship is dealing with the objects you are working with and the amount of items that will be stored inside the catagories you are working with. For example if you are dealing with an array of a movies in the action category if you do one way embedding it might not work out to well if you decide to embed a movie into a category because that category is so large as they constantly add new movies it will eventually surpass the 16mb limit. If you are dealing with more niche or smaller amounts of items it might be better do two way embedding because the items may only have a limit of a couple items so it wont hard to manage and it also wont break the 16mb limit. The best practice is using the third collection embedding because it pulls specific items from each object and puts it into a third object which has a piece of information from the other two. It is all about looking at your collection of data and deciding the right tool for the job.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway that I got from todays assignment is working on my put request I didn't fully understand the idea of the body and I ran into an issue where when I was trying to do a put method on my database of houses it was not working and could not find the specific house that I wanted however when I was using my getById method it was working. The reason it wasn't working for my put method is because I was sending the ID but I was not sending the body as well but the way to fix this was to send two parameters through my controller or write this line of code "req.body.id = req.params.id" which is saying that my body that I am sending is equal to the Id that I was sending and then at that point I only had to send one of those parameters for my code to function correctly. It was a great learning experience and another example of how you achieve the same thing in different ways.

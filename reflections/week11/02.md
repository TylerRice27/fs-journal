## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

Primary keys are unique information that is meant to identify information on a SQL table. Primary keys can not be duplicates of each other, so they have to be unique and they cant be null so they are required information. A foreign key is what reference your primary key on another table to pull the specif item that you want from the other table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias allows developers to rename a specific parts of their code to a more condensed easier to read name that can be used in place of the actual name of code. In the case of SQL tables an alias is declared after first instance of the written name. An example of this in SQL tables is "cars c ON c.id" where the cars table can now be referred to has just c in replace of spelling out cars.id.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

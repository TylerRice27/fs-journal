## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope determines where your variables are available for use. You have globally scoped or function/local scoped. Globally scoped means the variable is declared outside of the function or in other words outside of the bracket. Where as function scoped means that the variable is declared inside the function. If a function is locally scoped it can only be applied with in that function. Meaning variables can only go inward they can not outward.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a method in Javascript where it will move variables and declared functions to the top of their scope weather it is globally or locally scoped. Hoisting can occur with var, const or let variables however they work differently with var it is initialized with a default value where as let and const will throw an uninitialized.


3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

I believe you would want to use var as a variable naming convention if you are working with a variable that you may want to update or re-declare later on down the road in your code where as let and const you can not be redeclare. You would want to use const when you are working with a variable that you would want to remain constant and most likely never change throughout your project. Finally the most preferred method of variables, let allows you to scope using global or with block scope and fixes the weakness that var has by not allowing you to redefine a variable that has already been defined prior reducing the risk of bugs in your code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Some takeaways that I learned from our assignment today was that it is important to practice good naming convention because it is easy to get confused or name things a similar name or even the same name and not know which one is the right function to call upon or invoke. The next takeaway that I learned that goes along the same lines is to console log almost everything that way if something breaks down the line you can see with your console log what is broken and at least know what section of your code you should look at to try and fix the problem. Also finally I learned with console logging that you can actually log values and strings for example in my project I logged

Example:

 console.log(eaglesnumber, 'eagles number');


which makes it easer to go back see what the exact value is rather 
just seeing a bunch of numbers on my screen.

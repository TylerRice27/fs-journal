## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

 The main ways to write information on the console log are by writing conditional statements, reading printed errors or messages,
 viewing data from your java script files and finally testing functions. A conditional statement you would want to use your console log for is a true/false situation or an if/else statement to see if returns true or false or if the results are what you expected. Reading printed errors will happen if your code breaks and it will tell you what line that the code broke on and gives you a hint whether it is syntax related or undefined. Also you can log in your VS code and that will also print to the console. You would want to test a function if your function that you wrote in VS code is not giving you the results you were expecting. You can write that function in your console and it will tell you in real time after you write what it defined as the answer whether it is a number, string or undefined.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The element tab allows you to see all of your HTML and CSS in one tab. It allows you to go through lines of your HTML or use your selector tool to click on a specific item to bring you to that line of code. From there you can check to see if there is something wrong with the HTML or play around with CSS and your design. You can toggle different things on and off like width or padding with the style tab to the right of the code. It also allows you to see those changes in real time.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Another way to debug your code is by typing in debugger in you VS code and it will stop your code on the line where you put debugger and you can go step by step through a function and even skip functions if you need to. A second option that is similar to putting debugger in your code is by opening up the source tab which also allow you to go by step by step in your code. Also you can edit the code in real time to hopefully come up with solutions for the different lines that are causing you problems. Lastly it is important to note that when your code is paused on the line of code performing the action which defines a variable inside a function it will come up as undefined so it has to step down a line to be defined which you can hover over and it will tell you what it was defined as.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway that I got from todays assignment is that if your dealing with multiple arrays in your project you cant simply just create a function that says array1.find and array2.find and it will go find those items in the arrays that you want. In lecture when we were going through the project as a class we were pulling items from the same array with one find array line and a if statement to push the items to our cart if they were found. However when dealing with multiple arrays it will only look through the one array unless I decided to write a .find and a if statement for each array. However there is an easier way of doing this with Mark's help he explained to me that I could create a variable and set it equal to all arrays using this method let allitems = [...array1, ...array2] and it would take all the items from array 1 and 2 and put them in the same pool so when I want to find my items all I have to do is type allitems.find and it will go through multiple arrays using the code I wrote just before. For me it was kind of like a mind blown moment because one it was less code to write and two even though it was less code written it made more sense in my brain and helped me grasp the concept better.

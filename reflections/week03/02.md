## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation helps with a few different errors and problems that arose before encapsulation was created. Firstly it solved race conditions which would grab in different order when it ran so it could alter the results that you were given and not work correctly all the time. Encapsulation helps the code almost run at the same time or at least pause one while gets the right method to fire first helping with getting the right results every time. Finally it helps you change your data down the road by not allowing tight coupling so you can add new data and even change the implementation of the data later on.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

The problem with closures and the underscore prefix is that a lot of junior developers would not know what the underscore prefix meant and so they would use the code that was meant to be private and would instead export it or make it public to other files. The other problem is with senior developers who might ignore the rule of underscore methods that you want to be private but assuming they know what they are doing and would make the method public anyway.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

You can create a private variable in a class by creating a class and then inside that class' brackets you can create a private variable using the hashtag symbol. The reason you would want to do this is if you only wanted your variable you are creating to be only be used in that class and cant be globally scoped or used in any subclasses.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One of the things that I have been trying to work on is feeling stuck when first starting a project and also when I want to create a function to do something. During my project I think I got disorganized jumping back and forth in different files and I think I should break things down and start with one problem at a time and then also take a moment and ask myself what am I trying to achieve and what function would be best for this situation. Another takeaway that I got is when creating my arrays in my AppState never make the individual items like "new Snack" plural only make the array itself plural because it will mess your code up down the road and it is hard to follow and read. Finally the last takeaway is take a little bit longer to type things in, giving your intellisense time to pop up so you can tab into the right word correctly and also pull the instance of word from another file and instantly export it over.

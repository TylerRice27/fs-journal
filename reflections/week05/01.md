## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string allows you to pass information to and from websites by appending or adding to the end of a url. This allows you to add data to the end of a url like filtering certain items or it allows you to update or edit certain items by using a query string.


2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

An example of a query format is http://coolwebsite.com/test?a=1&b=2 In this example the query string start after the question mark symbol everything after the question mark symbol is the query string information. In this example a=1 is one parameter and b=2 is the second parameter and they separated by the & symbol which distinguishes the difference between each parameter.


3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

I think the Query parameter will be most useful when getting one item, doing a put request and finally doing a delete request. In my mind it makes sense you would want to send the id or the name of a specific item you want to find by passing a query parameter. After finding that item by passing that query parameter from one website to the other then you can run your crude functions to be able to get that item, edit or delete it entirely because you send that request through the query parameters.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

One takeaway that I got while doing this afternoon assignment is that it makes it much easier if you structure all of your async methods in same order on the controller, router and the service. It just makes the content easier to read and follow along with as well as debug if you run into problems later down the road. The other takeaway that I got is how to setup my workspace on Postman and read some errors on the debug console on my vs code which I still need practice on but it was a totally new way to find bugs in my code.

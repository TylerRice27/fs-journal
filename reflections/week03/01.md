## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Exporting helps with a few different things first is the ES6 module is strict by default so you don't have to "use strict" instead you just have to export the modules you want out of your file. Exporting also helps you with debugging your code and keep your code cleaner by having all of your like minded methods grouped in the same Javascript file.

2. How does export differ from export default?

Export files you can export one file at a time or you can export multiple files at once. However when you import the files in your other Javascript file you have to use the same name that you used in your exported javascript file where as with export default you can also export multiple files however when you go to the imported file you are allowed to use a different name for the file.


3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Module system is the newer industry standard of writing Javascript and the benefits allow you keep your code in smaller sections in like minded javascript files like the controller which function is talk to the HTML page. It is also easier to debug your code because it sectioned in smaller groups when it gives you an error. It allows you export and import only the things you needed and keeps other functions that are not being exported private which helps with page loading performance. It also helps with naming conventions with allowing you to name things the same thing as long they are not in the same javascript file. You can also use alias which might be easier for the programmer and the people maintaining the code easier to understand.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

My biggest takeaway from today assignment was more of a life lesson. The conceptional idea of the MVC method makes sense to me basically you are sectioning your code in things that are grouped, and giving each javascript file one objective and typically one files talks to only one other file. I guess the takeaway that I learned was that even though you understand the idea it is much harder to actually execute and put the MVC method into action when you have to code your projects. Before today's class I watched Mark's video and he explained it really well of what each file is doing and some of the different language like export, import and encapsulation. However even though I had a good understanding of a basic overview of the model and principals of it I was still finding myself struggling to execute the project with things like getting files linked up together and just getting my templates to the page so I could at least have some content on the page.

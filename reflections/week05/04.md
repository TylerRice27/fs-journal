## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

A virtual property is additional information that is given to a model on an item that exists outside of the database. Virtuals can either be defined automatically or manually and you can use a get method to define a virtual by creating a function for it or writing it out every single time. You can also use a set method on a virtual to set a pass a function and then set it using that function later down the road.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

A virtual might be really useful when you are coding a project and you are reusing the same variable or function over and over again throughout your project instead of having to code out that function multiple times you can instead set it to a variable and then just call that variable at certain times throughout your project which should make writing your code easier and also easier to read your code.


3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

I believe that you would have to search the value by the original value from the Schema that you got from your Mongoose database because your virtual only exists on documents and not in your database I believe you have to search its value by the original schema model you got from Mongoose.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

We did not do any coding on our project today because we were getting ready for the hackathon but one takeaway I got was how important the planning part of the process was and listening to everybody's ideas and trying to build off people ideas in constructive way that reach our end goal of our project. We made plans from everything from frontend to backend to timeboxing breaks and partners. Finally another takeaway was how important figma was that we learned in week one it allowed all of us to get a visual representation of what we wanted the site to look like and then we were able to style it very quickly to decide what our hopes for end goal was going to look like and function.

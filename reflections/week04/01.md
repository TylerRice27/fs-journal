> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

The signs of Callback Hell is when you have this symbols "})" at the very bottom of all of your functions. This happens because people write code top to bottom chronologically as they would assume the code would execute line by line. Callback Hell is caused by poor code writing and the misunderstanding of how Javascript reads code.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means that the result or thing you want to happen will take some time or will happen the future. A callback is when you write a function into another function but you do not invoke the function inside, instead once the outside function is complete it will callback to the function within the parentheses and run once the outer function has been completed. Basically your Javascript code will jump around and pull from different functions based on when things are needed or are complete.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

The first way is to keep your code shallow by using good naming conventions making the code easier to read and also moving all of the functions to the top of the page. The next way is to modularize your code which is writing your code that each function does one thing and then assembling many of those functions together into a module which executes a bigger task. It is almost like making folders within folders of a project that overall goal and it makes your code easier to read. The third way to fix Callback Hell is handle every single error and because you never know when an error will occur you always want to write your first argument within a callback function to be error argument so that way you are planning for any errors that may occur and it is also a good coding habit.

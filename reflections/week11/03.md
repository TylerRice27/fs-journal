## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

An SQL injection is a type of attack that gives the attacker complete control over your database by inserting arbitrary SQL code. SQL injection are also the most common types of malicious attacks and easiest to do but also are the easiest to prevent.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

One method of attack is an in-band SQL which the attacker will send incorrect information to try and get error messages to send back to them and try to figure out the database from to be able to attack it properly. Another version of attack is the Blind SQL which sends information to the database and waits for a boolean of weather or not it is true or false and then tries to work out the information from the true or false response. Another form of attack is a time attack where the injection may happen way earlier than when the attack runs and basically remains dormant until it is activated and then runs immediately



3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

Originally they built promises to fix the problem of callback hell in 2015 but later noticed promises would cause problems by making the code more complex. Async/Await fixed both problems by building on top of promises and also making the look synchronous instead of it being asynchronous making it easier to read. You are basically sending out a promise and awaiting the response of that promise and running a specific code based on the promise that was returned.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

Inside an async function you must put the word "await" in front of the line of code taking in the promise. The await line will wait for the promise that was sent out by the async function and then once it gets the results to that promise it will perform it's action accordingly.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

The first benefit it makes the code easier to read for a few different reasons one being it uses an words that we actually use in our english language making the code easier to read for developers. It also makes the code easier to read because unlike promises it makes the code look synchronously making it easier to read even though it is not. The other benefit it makes it easier to chain functions together for longer periods of time easier and also easier to read. Finally it makes it easier to debug because code looks synchronously the debugger that you throw on your code steps line by line and since your code is written in such a way it makes it easier to debug and go through each step of your code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The takeaway that I got from this assignment was more of a debugging method and a way to problem solve through my problems when I get stuck. Besides asking myself what I am trying to achieve and what functions would be the right tool for the job. Another tool I can use that I did not know about was that I can control click on my functions and methods that I have created and it will take me to other parts of my code where that method is used. In class I was stuck on the code I was writing and where to go next however Harrison showed the control click tool and it was a really cool way skip from my controller to my service to help myself not get lost and kind of track my code and what each step is doing. The other takeaway I saw was logging the "res.data" by logging the res I was able to see how the api we worked with today was named and also that I was getting the information so I knew that the problem was somewhere with my code in controller and service.

## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

In SQL the row information is the whole object itself where as columns are the specific properties on that object. Example row would be a Movie object and the column could be the director who directed that movie.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
    id int NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(200),
    age VARCHAR(200),
    description VARCHAR(300)
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
The difference between Delete From and Drop Table is that Delete From line is removing a row of data from the table of houses so it is essentially removing one house from the collection of houses. Where as the Drop Table is deleting the entire collection of data for all the houses in that table and once you delete that table you can not retrieve the data.

## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use? 

A Pseudo-Class targets a selected item when the user targets an element on the page. Some common ones might be hover, link ,enable and disable. An example is hover when the user hovers over a button the button might change color.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is what element takes precedent over the page. A way this might be used to our benefit is by having a bunch of img tags on the page but maybe one specific image you want to make bigger or draw more attention too so you could put a class or an id on that specific image to allow you to just adjust that image by itself

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature? 

One problem I could see someone running into is applying the same color to all of their h6 tags to bring attention to them but instead of using the specificity system if they wanted to change that color they would have to go back into each line of code that they wrote !important and fix each one instead of just referring back to their CSS page and changing one element that applies to all h6 tags.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The biggest takeaways that I got are always do your styling in your CSS page and link that to your HTML page so that way your CSS contains all of your styles in one location. That way if you want to change something it will save you more time in the long run by adhering to this rule. Another takeaway was the specificity rule and the value that each one has and that they are added on to each other for example

div#title.box: {

}

Lastly the final big takeaway that I had was while building my website I struggled with getting the right side of my page to align with the left side of my page. My right side of my page was always pushed down even though I was trying to give more margin on the bottom but I did not add my <main> tag and my d-flex class so when I was putting the rest of my content in nothing was happening but as soon as put my d-flex class on my main tag everything was able to be moved to make the website look nicer.

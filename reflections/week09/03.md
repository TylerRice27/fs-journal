## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is an encoding schema that encodes your data from a binary format into a text format that way it can be used in database that do not support binary data and instead encodes it into a text format which is supported by HTML and CSS.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

The drawbacks to Base64 is that it increases your file size of your images that you are sending over which increases your download times when it comes to loading your website. It also puts more of a strain on your CPU because your computer has to first decode the Base64 before it decodes the image itself causing more work. Base64 also does not allow you to store the images to your local server but instead will have to make multiple calls to your server.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Base64 seemed to always have these drawbacks but where not prevalent in the past. In the past you were not able to make as many requests to your server or some requests would have to wait while for other request to finish. Base64 would allow you to not have to make has many requests which was faster than waiting for those requests to finish before the other ones could fire but with our current internet we are able to make more requests at the same time making those requests faster than waiting for your Base64 file to decode. It also seems to be a security risk if not done properly when using Base64 in today's age.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

A takeaway from today's work was how important it was to take a longer sprint meeting after finishing our MVP of our project. After we finished the rest of our MVP and deployed our project for the first time we took a longer sprint meeting to talk about all the items that we put into our phase two of our project all the way back in week one and discuss what we wanted to keep or move to phase three or trash all together. I believe this was a great idea and great time to take a longer break to plan for the future and also a retrospective on what is most important for our project moving forward based on the amount of time we have and our overall goal for our application.

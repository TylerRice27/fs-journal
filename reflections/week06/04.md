Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway that I got from yesterday is watching a different way of setting up a project in vue. I was partnered with Dom and he immediately put a component inside the homepage and then started all the styling right on the component with the same results of the way I usually do it where I style on the homepage and then cut it out and paste into the component. It achieves the same results but it was a cool way of watching somebody else code and be able to get their project up and running much faster than I usually do by just doing the steps in a different manner.

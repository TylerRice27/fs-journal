## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

The three main types of testing that we can accomplish in Vue are unit testing, component testing and finally end to end testing. Unit testing allows you to test individual lines of code in isolation to provide confidence in the code you have written. Component testing gives you tools on the DOM to help figure out if there are bugs in your code with Vue specific plugins to help you. End to end testing allows you to test the application start to finish and test it as your user would use the application.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I believe the most useful testing method in my opinion would be unit testing. The reason I think that unit testing might be really valuable as a testing method over the other two is that it allows to test code in isolation allowing you to have debug less code if it doesn't work. It is similar to the code small test small principle so you don't have to go back through a whole file trying to find what you missed. The next part of this is the ability to be confident in code you have already written once you tested it so you can close that file or collapse that section of code and work on another section of code with the piece of mind that the previous code you have already written is good to go. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

The testing method that I think is least useful in my opinion is end to end testing. The problem that I could forsee with end to end testing is the scope of the test because you are testing a product exactly as a user would use the application probably once most of the code has already been written and looking at deployment of your code. I do think however end to end has its merits especially if you are launching a huge website or update end to end testing would be great for QA team to make sure it is ready for the outside world I just think it would be better test in smaller sections like unit testing or component testing that way you test throughout your production process and you have less code to debug to solve your issue.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

A takeaway that I saw today while working on our project is how important it is to some time switch up the partners that we were coding with or just ask for help from one of the other group members that you are not paired with while programming. The example that I will give is that Owen and I where working on a frontend problem with website and getting a page built out and we were making good progress but at one point we just stuck with getting the data the page because of a backend issue and we tried to figure it out together for about 30 mins or so and we were just not seeing where the problem was but after taking a break and asking one of other group members to come over and take a look at it we were able to figure it out together and I think it is an important lesson while working in a group together to ask for help from one another if a specific team is stuck on a certain problem for a really long time. It also helps to mix up the partners to put people who are more experience with people with less experience and visa versa so we can all learn and be challenged through out the process of our capstone.

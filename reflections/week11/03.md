## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

An SQL injection is a type of attack that gives the attacker complete control over your database by inserting arbitrary SQL code. SQL injection are also the most common types of malicious attacks and easiest to do but also are the easiest to prevent.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

One method of attack is an in-band SQL which the attacker will send incorrect information to try and get error messages to send back to them and try to figure out the database from to be able to attack it properly. Another version of attack is the Blind SQL which sends information to the database and waits for a boolean of weather or not it is true or false and then tries to work out the information from the true or false response. Another form of attack is a time attack where the injection may happen way earlier than when the attack runs and basically remains dormant until it is activated and then runs immediately



3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

We can us prepared statements by forcing the user to have pass in values that are already predefined and if the hacker sends a query that is not desired value it will never execute the query statement. Another thing we can do is limit account privilege so users can not be allowed to drop tables or database just in case something slips past validation and only give those kind of privileges to the Admins of the website.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

A takeaway from today's assignment is mapping out the path of your backend before you write out your backend methods. My partner and I were struggling with getting all of the followers and the people being followed by a specific account because the naming convention and the route made it really confusing. However by mapping it out in a notes first and walking through it we had a better understanding of which controller we needed to start in and halfway through we created a new controller to make it easier to access that information for our Api call on the backend and on the frontend in the future. Which really shows the importance of writing things out before you code specifically for routes.

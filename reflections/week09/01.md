## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

One principle that we are using for our project is something that we learned all the way back in week one which is mobile first. Our website can be used in desktop mode as well has in mobile mode but we have spent a lot of time in mobile view making sure everything looks really good in mobile and also functions well because of the idea of our app being able to search foods it would be much more practical to be used on a phone rather than on a laptop so that is one key principle we have been sticking to and always trying to keep in mind. Since we are designing in mobile first we are also trying to keep in mind user interface and making it easy for the user to use the application in the least amount of button presses and also make it easy for user to know where to go and give the user helpful error messages if something is wrong.

2. What went well so far?

We are doing a great job has a group hitting our mvp goal and making good progress on hitting that desired MVP status where we have a functional website. I also think we do a great job at communicating about our project and what we have been working on has we pair program. We also do a great job at coming together every couple of hours and updating our trello board and also talking about what we things we have all just finished and pushing/pulling to make sure we don't have any merge conflicts making our time pretty efficient.


3. What would you do differently? Why?

One thing that I would have done differently is planning out a day to meet on our off week and also maybe communicating throughout the week. We do a great job communicating when we are in class and working on the project throughout the day but when it came to the our off week I think we kind of dropped the ball. I wish I would have reached out sooner and also planned an exact day, time and place to be able to meet that way we could have worked on our project a little more just giving us more time to get to phase 2 and 3 items to be able to make the best website that we can so it makes it a better portfolio piece and also allows us has a team to keep up our coding skills.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

I think a takeaway from today was planning and specifically scrum planning. It was nice to be able to sit down with Mark and show him what we had and what we have been working on. Mark gave us some great ideas to help with our project but one big thing was planning out tomorrow before we jump into phase 2 of our project. I think this is a good thing to be aware of before we jump into phase 2 to be able to cut anything we don't want or make changes were we think that it is needed before we start coding. I think this helps me has a scrum master to look at just phase 2 and break them down into smaller items and decide what are we working on today and also what are we working on for the rest of the week.

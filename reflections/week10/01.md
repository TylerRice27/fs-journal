## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three different categories of data types are Value types, Reference types and finally Pointer types. A value type is like hard data or a value like X = 50 where as a reference type is more like a theoretical values where we give it meaning like strings or in a sense words.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The data types for the value types are bools, byte, char, decimal, double and int to name a few. A difference that I notice are that in Javascript theses a lot of these types like bools and int are actually classified as different types in Javascript where as in C# they are all under the umbrella of a value type.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types will store the variable that you are aliasing out into a different section of memory within the RAM of the computer and will store the value of that variable in a different section of memory within the RAM. This is different than Value types because it stores the value and the variable of that object together in the same section of memory within the RAM.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment


There were a lot of different little takeaway's from today's assignment since it was my first time learning C# and how it is similar to Javascript but also very different at the same time. The first takeaway that I got was how different the syntax and just learning how to type the new syntax. One thing that I really liked was that each line had a ";" the reason I liked this is it made it easy to follow no exactly what error I was getting at the end of my code and as time went on I got better at putting them in the first time. Another takeaway was the explicit language. I made a dictionary today while I was working on my rock, paper, scissors game and when I made the dictionary I put (int, string) which helped me follow the code because I have already told it what it needs to be so later down the line when I added to that dictionary my intellisense helped me a lot with telling me what kind of data type it would take in to build a new item for my game.

## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us as software developers to a develop a relationship between two different classes. It creates a child and a parent relationship between the two classes. The child class inheritances code from the parent class allowing the developer to be able to reuse code.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Member inheritance affects the visibility of classes and wether or not they are accessible to be inherited. It also affects what can be inherited. Not all members of a base class can be inherited. Constructors and finalizers can not be inherited members of a base class.


3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Accessibility affects what class can be inherited based on their visibility type. Private member classes can not be inherited by child classes and are locked down to their base class. Protected or internal classes can only be visible in child classes meaning they are supposed to be used with inheritance. Finally public classes are the most accessible and can be inherited and called as if they were declared in the child class.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment gave me a better understanding of how many to relationships work and to access the right crude routes through the right controllers to achieve my desired result. In class inheritance made a lot of sense with the mammal and dog example Mark made but while practicing the afternoon assignment I struggled with the "Ivacation" and how that inheritance from the cruise and I need more practice with inheritance to get more familiar.

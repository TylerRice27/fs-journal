## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.



I feel I am in a weird place and maybe I am not alone but I feel that during this course I have learned so much but at the same time I have barley grazed the surface. I feel as though I have much more to learn to become an even better software developer. Personally I am going to look into more certifications after the program to better my skills, hopefully while also working as a software developer at a company. Personally the one thing I am disappointed in is that I didn't finish all spice all the way before the final and I think that would have really helped me out to have that whole project complete for reference purposes. I know that I lack self confidence in my abilities but no matter what I am planning on trying my best when it comes to the final and really taking advantage of the weekend over the break. I have definitely enjoyed the course over the last three months even though sometimes I wanted to break down and had a lot of fun learning new skills and making new friends along the way. Also the staff was fantastic I know I was a student that asked a lot of questions and got tutoring quite often and I don't think I would have made this far without the kindness of everyone that works at CodeWorks.

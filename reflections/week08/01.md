## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

A developer portfolio shows off your skills as a software developer showing that you know your craft and also you are also increasing your brand reputation as a software developer with your developer portfolio. It also gives you the ability to show off all the different coding languages that you may to show you are adaptable or it gives you the ability to show off that specific language that a company is looking for and the projects you can make with that language or framework.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

It shows off your skills as a developer as well as solve problems. Besides having good code and a website that looks good it is also important to think about reasons why you are building your website. It will look really good as a developer if you developer portfolio solves a problem for your needs or others. It also is a good time to try and build a smaller version of bigger websites or a website for the company you are applying for showing that you can innovate on what people have done before and giving the projects your twist to them showing off your skills and creativity.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

The first project that I would probably include in my portfolio that I have built so far is Checkpoint-5 the Network. The first reason is because I really liked the project and the idea behind the project showing off my skills to make an application that allows you to send messages to other users. I also think that specific project came out really nice and demonstrates a lot of my skills that I have learned in the process of being at codeworks. Another project I would put in my portfolio is my the first project that I made on day one with html not really showing my skills as a programmer but more just showing where I started in developer journey and all that I have learned in such a short time hopefully making my later projects that I show more impressive.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

A takeaway that I got while working on todays planning for our capstone is to listen to everyone's ideas while also trying to organize those ideas in an effective way. What I mean by that is I started to notice that people would give out ideas for the website that were really great ideas but were more stretch goal ideas rather than the core ideas of our application. Which is a great thing that shows everyone in our group is passionate but I think that we need to be careful and make sure we have a Min. product ideas down first and then we can start to put the really cool ideas after so we don't get distracted on the really cool ideas and spend to much time them before we hit our minimal goal.

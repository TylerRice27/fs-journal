## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Software development testing is where you test the smallest unit of code for your method to achieve the desired results. You are testing on an interface level the fine details are not has important has does the function work and desired effect for the user who is using the website. Also in software development testing you want to ideally to test one method independently that way if you are testing a component in your app you can test multiple different methods with different tests and know which method is broken so you can fix it to get your intended results.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

It gives developers peace of mind that their product is tested and working properly as they intended allowing them the peace of mind to focus on other tasks that may come up rather than code they may have wrote before hand. It also allows you to test your methods you write in isolation making sure that each method you write is working as intended this is useful in sense that you don't have to build the whole project out and then test but instead can test a single component of your project before you send it to the quality assurance department. This also might save your company time and money in the long run by spending a little more time testing using unit testing it might allow it pass QA faster where they test the whole application.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

Some potential drawbacks to unit testing when it comes to software development might be that it could be time consuming to write out tests to test your code that you have already written and even though it might be wise to do so many companies may see it has a waste of time or not worth the effort because they have a QA team. The other drawback is that you won't catch all the bugs because unit testing is setup to test a component in isolation it is inevitable that eventually you will miss a test or write a test wrong and end up missing a bug that made it through your development process.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

A takeaway that I got today for our project was naming conventions and making sure we name things the same as a group and also name things correctly. Mark during our presentation suggested that we change the name of our collection to quests to be on brand with our application as well to not have conflicts with reserved key words with mongoDB. So what I did as we started to do our final group meeting before we started writing code I wrote our new names on the whiteboard and aliased them to what we used to call them and also drew lines to show the parent and child relationships between our different models to make it easier as a group to reference as we all start to code.
